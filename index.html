<p class="para"> In DATA, Tainy creates a cyborg-human hybrid named Sena 瀬奈, with the goal of making her as close to a human being as possible. He strives to achieve this by uploading human emotions and memories through music. Music, in many ways represents the meaning of life: all the emotions and memories we humans feel and create during our lifetime.
With each uploaded song, Sena becomes more complete. The process of uploading songs as information into Sena’s computerized mind is a metaphor. Each song on the album represents a feeling or a memory that Sena experiences. Through Sena’s upload process, we witness her transformation and can reflect on what it means to be ‘human’.</p>
